NOTES:

- Attackers are impersonating targeted organizations' help desks via Teams to deliver AdaptixC2 malware.
- Attackers utilize Windows' Quick Assist feature to run a malicious PowerShell script on a victim's host.
- A recent example of this malicious PowerShell script we saw on 2025-05-13 is named Update.ps1.
- The update.ps1 file downloads a file that is converted to shellcode for an AdaptixC2 beacon.

ADAPTIXC2 DETAILS:

- Often called "AdaptixC2" or "Adaptix C2," the name refers to a publicly available post-exploitation framework.
- This framework is intended for red team members and penetration testers.
- Adaptix C2 is relatively new, and it has been available on GitHub since August 2024.
- Like Cobalt Strike and other red team tools, Adaptix C2 can be abused for malicious purposes.
- More information on Adaptix C2 and the Adaptix Framework is available at:
  -- https://adaptix-framework.gitbook.io/adaptix-framework
  -- https://github.com/Adaptix-Framework/AdaptixC2
- So far, very little malware has been publicly identified as AdaptixC2:
