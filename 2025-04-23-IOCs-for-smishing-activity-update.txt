NOTES:

- Since the FBI announcement 1 year ago, we have found and blocked over 91,500 root domains used for SMS phishing (smishing).
- This activity has gained more momentum in the previous month, with a peak in registration of 26k domains in March 2025. 
- This activity generally matches four unique domain naming patterns:
  -- com-[a-z0-9]*.(xin|top|vip|cc|sbs|cfd|xyz|cyou|icu|info|world|live|win|homes|help|one|us|shop|fun|life)
  -- paytoll[a-z0-9].(top|vip|xin|world|icu|com)
  -- delivery[a-z0-9]*.*
  -- gov-[a-z0-9]*.(cc|com|xin|top|online|org|site)
- NOTE: The above search expressions are not an exhaustive list of top-level domains (TLDs), but they give a general idea of the root domain name patterns.

DETAILS:

- We've observed a continuously high volume of smishing domains registered so far in April 2025.
- The number of domains registered peaked in March 2025 with 26,328 domains for the month.
- In the past three months alone, our telemetry reveals over 31 million queries for domains involved in this activity.
- 75.4% of these domains have the same registrar: Hong Kong (Dominet (HK) Limited).
- We observed increasingly more smishing traffic from this campaign in 2025 compared to 2024.
- The smishing domains are short-lived, with 70% of the traffic happening within 7 days of the domain's registration. 
- Blocking Newly Registered Domains (NRDs) for a month can effectively filter out 85% of this smishing traffic.
- Attackers use cloaking techniques for this activity, and they increasingly tailor the lures based on the area code geolocation of the recipients' phone numbers.
- Initial FBI announcement in April 2024 is available at: https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2024/PSA240412
