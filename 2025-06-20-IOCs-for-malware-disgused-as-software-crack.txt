2025-06-20 (FRIDAY): FAKE SOFTWARE CRACKS CONTINUE TO PUSH MALWARE

AUTHOR:

- Bradley Duncan

NOTES:

Criminals continue to post links on social media to pages for malware disguised as software cracks.
- These pages lead to zip archives that contain password-protected 7-Zip archives.
- These pages and file names contain the password for the 7-Zip archives.
- The initial archive file names also use non-ASCII characters.
- We've previously seen Lumma Stealer and StealC v2 from these types of campaigns.
- Today's example consists of a different malware family we have not yet fully analyzed.
