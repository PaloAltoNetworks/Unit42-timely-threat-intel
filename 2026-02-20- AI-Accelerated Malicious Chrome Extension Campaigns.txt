NOTES:

We keep track of LLM/AI-generated malicious Chrome extensions. Threat actors are increasingly weaponizing LLM/AI code-generation tools to mass-produce malware.
We identified two different campaigns that were using code generation to accelerate their attacks.
  -- 6 malicious Chrome extensions that are being used in an affiliate hijacking campaign
  -- 4 malicious extensions providing dual functionality of GenAI productivity tool and sensitive data exfiltration
 Attackers are moving at the speed of AI. Our defense must too.

DETAILS:

 These extensions are AI-generated and malicious, affecting users across multiple e-commerce platforms. As mentioned in the below reference, all extensions inject affiliate tracking links into the traffic to shopping sites without explicit user consent.
 AI-Generated Tell-Tale Signs:
  -- Overly verbose explanatory comments: AI language models tend to generate excessive comments that explain obvious operations in unnecessary detail.
Examples: aohfjaadlbiifnnajpobdhokecjokhab, gjlbbcimkbncedhofeknicfkhgaocohl, dkhpgbbhlnmjbkihoeniojpkggkabbbl
  -- Strategy labeling with section headers: AI  models often organize code with elaborate section headers using dashes or numbered steps mimicking tutorial-style code.
Example: aohfjaadlbiifnnajpobdhokecjokhab
  -- Generic error handling with minimal logging: AI-generated code often includes try-catch blocks that simply log or ignore errors without proper recovery logic.
Example: mpgaodghdhmeljgogbeagpbhgdbfofgb
  -- Defensive coding patterns: AI models tend to add unnecessary defensive checks that protect against edge cases that cannot realistically occur given the calling context.
Example: mpgaodghdhmeljgogbeagpbhgdbfofgb
  -- Template-like structure with generic naming: AI-generated code often uses generic, textbook style conventions and structural patterns that feel like they came from documentation examples rather than real-world applications.
Example: mcaihdkeijgfhnlfcdehniplmaapadgb, eebihieclccoidddmjcencomodomdoei
  -- Unfinished patterns and placeholder comments: AI-generated code sometimes includes comments suggesting future implementations or expressing uncertainty.
Example: mpgaodghdhmeljgogbeagpbhgdbfofgb
  -- Systematic naming conventions: AI tends to use systematic naming that follows strict patterns across the codebase, lacking the organic variation found in human-written code.
Examples: All affiliate hijacking extensions mentioned
  -- Identical code patterns across extensions: Multiple extensions share nearly identical code structures for the same functionality, suggesting that they were generated from similar prompts.
Example: mcaihdkeijgfhnlfcdehniplmaapadgb, mpgaodghdhmeljgogbeagpbhgdbfofgb, nppjmiadmakeigiagilkfffplihgjlec
Some strategies to defend against AI-generated malicious extension threats:
  -- Deploy code signatures to spot AI patterns in suspicious extensions
  -- AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) analysis to detect comment-to-code ratio, systematic naming pattern compliance
  -- Similarity detection across known AI-generated malicious extensions and new extensions
