MALICIOUS DOMAINS FROM THIS ACTIVITY:

- euromaidanwarszawa[.]org
- standwukrain[.]org

DETAILS:

- Suspected Belarus-based threat actor White Lynx was observed establishing typo-squatted domains masquerading as legitimate pro-Ukraine organizations in Poland. 
- The threat actor established two domains, euromaidanwarszawa[.]org and standwukrain[.]org, which appear related to recent information operations observed on social media.

  -- Malicious domain euromaidanwarszawa[.]org - Imitates Euromaidan-Warszawa
  -- Real domain: euromaidan-warszawa[.]org

  -- Malicious domain standwukrain[.]org - Imitates Stand with Ukraine Foundation
  -- Real domain: standwukraine[.]org

- These domains overlap with recently observed information operations attempting to degrade relationships between Poland and Ukraine. 
- The information operations were conducted on social media and included AI-generated videos.
- The AI-generated videos attempt to impersonate the President of Euromaidan-Warszawa and the Stand with Ukraine Foundation.
