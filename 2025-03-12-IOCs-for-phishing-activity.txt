2025-03-12 (WEDNESDAY): PHISHING ACTIVITY

AUTHORS:

- Jingwei Fan, Zeyu You, Ritesh Nanda, Wei Wang

NOTES:

- We are currently tracking a long-running phishing campaign with the following characteristics:
  -- A specific design template for the login window
  -- Consistent use of Clearbit's free Company Logo API
  -- Frequent use of obfuscated JavaScript to render the phishing pages
  -- Can sometimes display the spoofed organization's web page as a background of the phishing page

- Clearbit's "Company Logo API" is a free service that displays logos for many organizations. (More info at: https://clearbit.com/blog/logo)
- Unfortunately, like many other free services available to anyone, this API is frequently abused by criminals in phishing campaigns.
- We've noticed a significant percentage of phishing URLs from this campaign sent to Japan-based email addresses.
- However, recipients of these phishing URLs include various nationalities and industry vectors.
