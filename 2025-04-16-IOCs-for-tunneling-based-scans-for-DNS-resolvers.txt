NOTES:

- Since January 2025, multiple domains have been noted  in scanning activity using DNS tunneling techniques.
- These domains have been used in scans for DNS resolvers hosted on public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- The source IP address is spoofed as an adjacent destination IP address to bypass source IP address-based access control.
- The domain owner uses the IP 209.141.56[.]200 and 2605:6400:20:9d:2d8c:6f33:f4db[:]ab02 to host their nameservers.
- The FQDN encodes its destination IP as a hexadecimal string in the domain name. 
  -- For example, in the FQDN kugmx.c66e76fb.0.v4.isavscan[.]baby, c66e76fb equates to and IPv4 address of 198.110.118[.]251.
- Attackers can obtain the vulnerability information of a specific resolver by decoding the received FQDN from their controlled nameserver.
- We cannot determine the reason behind these scans.
- If this activity is for research purposes, then the absence of TXT/PTR records or websites to explain the research raises significant ethical concerns.
- The scanning technique in this campaign is similar to the SecShow campaign we previously reported.

- This is an ongoing activity that is being publicly questioned.

- Unlike the previously reported activity, in addition to IPv4, the attackers are now also scanning for resolvers on IPv6 addresses.
