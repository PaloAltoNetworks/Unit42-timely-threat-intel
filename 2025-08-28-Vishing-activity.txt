NOTES:

- Vishing is using phone calls for social engineering/phishing activity. The "v" in vishing stands for "voice."
- We have investigated several recent vishing cases targeting organizations through their IT helpdesks.
- Attackers initiate contact and impersonate company employees and claim to have lost access to their accounts.
- Attackers attempt to persuade IT help desk technicians to reset passwords or change the phone number associated with the targeted account.
- If the attempt is successful, the technician provides a temporary password or updates the account with an attacker-controlled phone number, or both.
- Attackers would next register their own devices for multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Finally, attackers access the targeted organization's payroll portal to modify payroll elections
- The goal is to redirect targeted employees' salaries to bank accounts the attackers control.

ADDITIONAL DETAILS:

- We observed targets primarily in the manufacturing and retail sectors, though other industries may also be at risk.
- Attackers possessed sufficient personally identifiable information (PII) to pass help desk identity verification
  -- This PII includes the targeted employee's full name, email address, employee ID and manager's name.
- Post-compromise activity extends beyond payroll fraud, including abuse of access to sensitive employee files and corporate email.
- To evade detection, attackers delete automated notification emails related to MFA enrollment and payroll system changes.
- Analysis of user-agent strings and MFA application logs indicates the attackers may have used iPhones as their devices for MFA enrollment.
- Analysis of call recordings indicates the attackers did not attempt to mask their voices.
  -- No voice modulation or attempt to hide the attackers' accents.
  -- These characteristics were consistent across multiple incidents.
- Analysis of IP addresses associated with this activity indicates the attackers predominantly used a VPN service when accessing targeted accounts.
- The attackers favor Voice Over IP (VOIP)/virtual phone numbers for these vishing attacks.
- All of the attacker-controlled bank accounts we have discovered so far are from a single, popular online-only bank.
