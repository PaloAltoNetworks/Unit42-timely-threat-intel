NOTES:

- We have investigated several recent cases involving attackers abusing Microsoft Teams.
- The attackers contact potential victims through Teams and impersonate the victim's Help Desk.
- They attempt to convince potential victims to run a Trojanized installer for GlobalProtect.
- GlobalProtect is a secure VPN/remote access solution for Palo Alto Networks customers.
- This wave of attack involves the following domains and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs):

  DOMAINS FROM LEGITIMATE SERVERS COMPROMISED BY ATTACKERS:

  -- cristox[.]cl
  -- deuscapacitaciones[.]cl
  -- parusiafm[.]cl
  -- pathernostrum[.]org
  -- sancupertino[.]cl

  FQDNS FROM LEGITIMATE SERVICES ABUSED BY ATTACKERS: 

  -- helpdesklocal.onmicrosoft[.]com - first publicly reported: 2025-04-24
  -- ithelpdepartment.onmicrosoft[.]com - not yet publicly reported
  -- pathernostrum.onmicrosoft[.]com - not yet publicly reported

- We observed email addresses starting with "andrewhelpdesk‚Äù from the associated Teams calls. 

DETAILS:

- After accessing a victim host, the attacker downloads and runs a file named globalprotect.msi.
- This is a Trojanized installer with a legitimate version of Global Protect.
- This installer is configured via the command line to use a C2 server at live-up[.]co.
- live-up[.]co was first registered in 2013 and has resolved to IP addresses from different hosting providers since then.
- On 2025-04-08, live-up[.]co started resolving to 164.92.67[.]56 shortly before these attacks started.
- The globalprotect.msi file spawns encoded PowerShell script to download additional malware that leads to MadMXShell. 
- We've identified new MadMxShell samples that use either HTTPS or DNS over HTTPS for C2 traffic.

SHA256 HASHES NOTED FOR TROJANIZED MSI FILES:
