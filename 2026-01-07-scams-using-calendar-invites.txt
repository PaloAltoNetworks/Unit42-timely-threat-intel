THE SCAM:

- These scam messages falsely claim that recipients have been charged for a product or billed for a subscription.
- They include a support number for recipients to call for any issues.
- Scammers wait for potential victims to call the support number to cancel the claimed charge.
- These support numbers lead to operators who ask potential victims to provide credit card or other sensitive info.

SCAM VIA CALENDAR INVITES:

- Recent months have seen an increase in these types of scams using calendar invites.
- We occasionally detect these in Google Calendar invites, but these are not limited to Google's ecosystem.
- .ics files use a standardized format that can be imported into any calendar app, like Apple, Google or Outlook.

- Several sources have recently highlighted this growing calendar invite threat, for example:

THE RISK FROM MALICIOUS CALENDAR INVITES:

- This method increases the chance that unsuspecting victims will add the fraudulent invite to their calendars.
- A calendar invite could give the scam messaging a false sense of legitimacy and urgency.
- Furthermore, if a victim's calendar syncs across devices, that calendar invite could appear on multiple hosts.

PROTECTION TIPS:

- Crucial Step: Check your email settings and turn off automated adding of invitations to your calendar.
- Immediate Action: If you spot a suspicious invite, immediately delete it from your calendar and block the sender. 
  - Do not engage with the sender or call the provided phone number.
