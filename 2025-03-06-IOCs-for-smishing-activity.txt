- The smishing entices users to reveal personal and/or financial information, including credit or debit card and account information.
- These smishing text messages originate from email addresses or phone numbers.
- Apple iMessage does not allow links in messages received from unknown senders.
  -- To bypass this, these smishing texts ask users to reply with "Y" and reopen the text.
  -- Such interaction from the user allows iMessage to enable links in the smishing texts.
