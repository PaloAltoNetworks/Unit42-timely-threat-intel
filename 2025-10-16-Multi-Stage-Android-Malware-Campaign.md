## Campaign Summary

- **Sophisticated Android Malware Distribution:** This campaign is a sophisticated Android malware distribution network that uses adult content as a social engineering lure.
- **Multi-Stage Architecture:** It employs a resilient, multi-stage architecture with front-end lure sites that use commercial-grade obfuscation and encryption to hide and dynamically connect to a separate backend infrastructure.
- **Obfuscation and Encryption:** The attackers use commercial-grade JavaScript obfuscation from jsjiami[.]com in the webpages and Triple DES encryption to hide their backend URLs and configuration data.
- **Evasion Techniques:** The front-end lure sites use deceptive loading messages and a series of checks, including the time it takes to load a test image, to evade detection and analysis.
- **Resilient Infrastructure:** A key highlight from the infrastructure graph is the separation between front-end lures and backend servers. This design enables attackers to quickly change lure domains without exposing their core backend infrastructure, making takedowns more challenging.
- **Dynamic Backend Infrastructure:** The campaign uses a dynamic backend infrastructure with stable IPs but changing subdomains to make it harder to block.
