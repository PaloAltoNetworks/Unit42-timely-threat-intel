## Campaign Summary

- **Sophisticated Android Malware Distribution:** This campaign is a sophisticated Android malware distribution network that uses adult content as a social engineering lure.
- **Multi-Stage Architecture:** It employs a resilient, multi-stage architecture with front-end lure sites that use commercial-grade obfuscation and encryption to hide and dynamically connect to a separate backend infrastructure.
- **Obfuscation and Encryption:** The attackers use commercial-grade JavaScript obfuscation from `jsjiami[.]com` in the webpages and Triple DES encryption to hide their backend URLs and configuration data.
- **Evasion Techniques:** The front-end lure sites use deceptive loading messages and a series of checks, including the time it takes to load a test image, to evade detection and analysis.
- **Resilient Infrastructure:** A key highlight from the infrastructure graph is the separation between front-end lures and backend servers. This design enables attackers to quickly change lure domains without exposing their core backend infrastructure, making takedowns more challenging.
- **Dynamic Backend Infrastructure:** The campaign uses a dynamic backend infrastructure with stable IPs but changing subdomains to make it harder to block.
- **Final Payload:**
  - The final impact is the surreptitious download of a malicious APK.
  - This payload is heavily obfuscated, with its core logic hidden in a native .so library to evade analysis.
  - It requests a dangerous combination of permissions, indicating capabilities for phishing overlays, screen capture, installing other malware, and manipulating the file system.
  - The filenames of the APKs vary slightly across different backend servers but maintain a similar naming convention.
  - **Deceptive Branding:** Post-installation, the app uses a generic name like 'first night' to blend in, while its logo uses branding (`CY51[.]TV`) that ties back to the adult-themed lure content, likely to reassure the user of its legitimacy.
  - **Aggressive Permissions & Instability:** The application is unstable and crashes if not granted an extensive list of highly invasive permissions, indicating it has no legitimate functionality and its sole purpose is to execute its malicious capabilities.

## Full Attack Chain

The attack is executed in a series of stages, starting with a sophisticated loader on the front-end domains and culminating in malware delivery from the backend infrastructure.

### Stage 0: Initial Access & Deceptive Loader

The victim is lured to one of the front-end domains (e.g., `0125[.]org`), which serves a malicious HTML loader. This page is not a simple redirect but an active component of the attack. While the malicious scripts execute, the page displays adult-themed animations or GIFs to distract the user.

- File: `hxxps://0125[.]org` (Hosted on `23.231.159[.]78`)

Deception: The page displays a fake loading animation with text like "网络检测中" (Network check in progress) and "正在进入最优线路..." (Now entering the optimal route...). This social engineering tactic keeps the user on the page while the malicious scripts execute in the background.

Encryption: The page contains a massive, encrypted Base64-encoded payload. It also imports the legitimate Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) cryptographic library from a Baidu CDN to perform the decryption.
