NOTES:

- Threat actors are distributing fake Chrome extensions posing as AI tools.
- These extensions let users type prompts in the Chrome search bar, but will hijack the prompts.
- Redirecting queries to attacker-controlled domains and tracking search activity.

DETAILS:

- We are observing a rise in malicious AI-themed browser extensions previously reported last month at:
  -- https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-timely-threat-intel/blob/main/2025-08-11-AI-summary-browser-extensions.txt 
​​- Threat actors publish Chrome extensions mimicking ChatGPT, Llama, Perplexity and Claude.
- This is part of a broader trend of impersonating AI extensions that are used for malicious redirects and search activity tracking.
- These extensions let users type prompts directly in the Chrome search bar, but hijack the data.
— The malicious extensions:
  -- Override the default search engine settings via the chrome_settings_overrides manifest key
  -- Redirecting queries to attacker-controlled domains like chatgptforchrome[.]com, dinershtein[.]com and gen-ai-search[.]com
  -- Track browser activity
- In 2023, we observed an extension called 'AI ChatGPT' that was tied to the domain chatgptforchrome[.]com:
  -- This extension had reached 15,800 users, and it contained obfuscated JavaScript to steal Facebook account details.
  -- More info at: https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/chatgpt-scam-attacks-increasing
- We found a new prompt-hijacking extension named ‘Chat AI for Chrome’ tied to the same chatgptforchrome[.]com domain:
  -- This extension is distributed through lures similar to the earlier 2023 'AI ChatGPT' extension.
  -- It has been promoted via YouTube to entice users into installation.
