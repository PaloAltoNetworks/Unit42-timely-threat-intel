2025-09-19 (FRIDAY): PHISHING CAMPAIGN TARGETING JAPANESE SPEAKERS

AUTHORS:

- Reethika Ramesh, Zhanhao Chen, Daiping Liu

NOTES:

- We've been tracking a recent wave of email-based phishing activity targeting Japanese speakers.
- These phishing campaigns impersonate companies like Amazon and Apple, banks and other airlines.
- Attackers craft emails disguised as notices on safety or fake purchases with convincing URLs to phishing sites.

DETAILS:

- Since April 2025, we have observed phishing emails impersonating many popular companies in Japan.
  -- The list of impersonated companies includes Amazon, Apple and Japan Airlines, among others. 
  -- Initial waves of these emails contained URLs that directed users to fraudulent Amazon CAPTCHA pages.
  -- These pages were likely designed to harvest user credentials and other sensitive data.
- In August 2025, we observed a second wave of emails where the URLs embedded in the email use the following format:
  jump.gdblmc[.]com/RAIMyn?www.amazon[.]co[.]jp/ap/signin. 
- The above URL redirects to the final landing page at www.amazon[.]co[.]jp.gearheinz[.]com/ap/signin,
  -- This URL mimics Amazon's domain name in its subdomain. 
  -- These landing pages are cloaked, directing visits to this site to a 404 error when crawled.
- In September 2025, we observed two different types of URLs embedded in the newest wave of phishing emails. 
  -- One set of URLs contains parameters that mimic real Amazon web URLs (/ap/signin/openid/net2F). 
     -- Like the August 2025 wave, associated landing pages for these URLs are also heavily cloaked. 
     -- However, we observe API calls made through JavaScript are called from within the webpage. 
     -- For example, URL hxxps[:]//vlupe[.]cn/ap/signin/openid/net2F/ makes API calls to the following url:
        hxxps[:]//vlupe[.]cn/open/?apiName=8F1C1nStkUrc8hsCSVns9JXVnQ9jB8ORjLCU3x1z3otqPKYDQMAfLNKqXLfOflnz 
        which returns a 404 Not Found error.
  -- The second set of URLs uses the format: secure.oamzon[.]co[.]jp.<DOMAIN>[.]<TLD>. 
     -- The subdomain secure.oamzon[.]co[.]jp in the above URL is a typosquatted domain, mispelling "amazon" as "oamzon" 
     -- Senders for this wave of emails have "Amazon.co.jp" listed in the sender’s name.
     -- But the sender’s email addresses belonged to different domain names.
- These phishing email campaigns are continuously evolving and continue employing cloaking techniques to hide their landing pages.
- For emails impersonating Amazon, the senders always have "Amazon" as the beginning characters of the email addresses. 
  -- Examples: Amazon.yumoka3@rflt[.]com and Amazon.ai_iii@vftvhnw[.]com. 
- Domains for these email sending addresses are a mix of older registered domains and more recently registered ones. 
- The associated domains are also under a range of different TLDs, including .com, .net, .jp, .co.id, .cn, etc.  
- We have observed similar phishing emails impersonating technology, travel, banking and investment sites, such as:
  -- Apple
  -- Mitsubishi UFJ Bank
  -- Sumitomo Mitsui Card Co
  -- Japan Airlines (JAL)
  -- ANA Airlines
- We track this campaign as: japan_phishcloak
