AUTHORS:

- Beliz Keleli, Alex Starov, Bradley Duncan

NOTES:

- Attackers are sending crypto-themed emails with links to pages posing as cryptocurrency platforms.
- However, this activity may also appear in traffic generated through web browsing.
- The long chain of events for this scam activity includes a fake specialist chatbot.
- Ultimately, the scam requires victims to transfer money to a bitcoin address controlled by the scammers.

DETAILS:

- These scams abuse telegra[.]ph and graph[.]org, two sites that act as minimalist publishing platforms.
- Anyone can use these sites to publish a simple web page very quickly.
- Scammers have leveraged these sites to create web pages that link to the malicious content.
- These scams involve a long and interactive chain of events that lead to a cryptocurrency payment page.
- These scams require considerable user interaction to be successful.
- Below is a scam from an active graph[.]org URL impersonating Binance
- The scam is a supposed cryptocurrency giveaway that victims are supposed to pay a tax on.
- This fake tax amount would be sent to a Bitcoin address controlled by the scammers.
