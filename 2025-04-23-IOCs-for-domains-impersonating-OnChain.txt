NOTES:

- We've identified at least 45 domains in a campaign that impersonates a blockchain development platform named OnChain.
- The purpose of this campaign appears to be stealing WalletConnect credentials used for the OnChain ecosystem.
- Sites using these domains share hosting infrastructure and similar file interactions.
- Login pages from these domains have a QR code sign-in to trick the users.

DETAILS:

- We identified 45 malicious domains in Apr 2025.
- Hosting and registration information:
  -- All 45 domains have been hosted on the same IP address.
  -- These domains share WHOIS registrant details, which are likely created through automation.
     --- An initial 13 domains were registered in December 2024 under the .xyz top-level domain (TLD).
     --- 30 more domains were registered in April 2025 under the .cfd TLD.
     --- We discovered two additional domains that do not follow the same naming conventions.
         ---- One was registered in November 2024.
         ---- One was registered in March 2025.
- Pages share similar content and show a strong correlation in file interactions (file loads/downloads).
- Pages show a QR code on the login page and a suspicious "Copy to Clipboard" link.
- Each login page QR code under these domains points to a different WalletConnect URL.
  -- Outdated Protocol: The links use the deprecated WalletConnect v1 protocol, which was officially shut down in June 2023.
  -- Expired Bridge URL: The bridge URL is no longer legitimate due to an expired SSL certificate.
  -- Phishing Attempt: The QR code initiates a connection request, potentially leading to a wallet phishing attack if approved.
  -- Risk: Approving the connection request could expose blockchain ID and wallet account information.
- Based on our telemetry, the primary targets of this campaign are users in the United States.
  -- Professional & Legal Services is the most commonly targeted industry.

QR CODE INFO:

QR codes under different login pages lead to different URLs, for example:

The QR code presented at:
