NOTES:

- Increasing Number of AI-Summary Browser Extensions: 
  -- There has been a notable rise in the availability and adoption of AI-powered browser extensions. 
  -- As per chrome-stats[.]com, approximately 40 AI-powered Chrome extensions for summarization have appeared so far this year. 
  -- Created every week, these types of Chrome extensions account for several thousand user downloads. 
  -- This gives threat actors an opportunity to collect sensitive information from unsuspecting users. 
- Unintended Data Exposure: 
  -- Such extensions share user data from applications like WhatsApp and Gmail to low-reputed websites like:
     --- askyumawebapp.fly[.]dev  (passive-DNS age of 1 day when we investigated)
     --- gosupersonic[.]email  (passive-DNS age of 55 days when we investigated)
- Recommendation: 
  -- Users are advised to investigate any installed AI browser extensions to mitigate potential data leakage.
  -- Review the permissions, reputation, and developer reputation and functionality of these AI browser extensions.
