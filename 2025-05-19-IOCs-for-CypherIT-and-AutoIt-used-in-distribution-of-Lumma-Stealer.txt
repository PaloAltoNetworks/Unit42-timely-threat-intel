  extracted Nullsoft installer for Lumma Stealer infection

NOTES:

- A variant of the CypherIT crypter is being used in the distribution of a Lumma Stealer variant via fake cracked software. 
- This campaign leverages AutoIt scripts and NSIS self-extracting archives for initial infection.
- The lures are spread through various sources, like social media platforms and files posted through online shared drives.
- This malware claims to be cracked versions of popular software like Siemen's data transfer tool WinPCIN or the CAD tool CATIA.

BACKGROUND:

- Sometimes called "CypherIt," CypherIT is an encryter originally sold through cypherit[.]org starting in 2018.
- CypherIT has been advertised as an encryption software to secure EXE files and evade antivirus detection.
- Cypherit[.]org's domain registration expired in 2020, but we still continue to see CypherIT used in recent malware samples.
- AutoIt is a free and legitimate scripting language that is commonly abused by various malware developers.
- More info on AutoIt at https://www.autoitscript.com/wiki/Main_Page

DETAILS:

- In this campaign, CypherIT leverages an NSIS script to drop the batch file.
- This batch file is responsible for combining all malicious content into a malicious AutoIt script and the AutoIt3.exe file to run it.
- The newly-created AutoIt script contains embedded shell code responsible for decrypting the final payload.
- The final payload is encrypted using an RC4 key and compressed using LZNT1 compression.
- This AutoIt script creates an explorer.exe process in a suspended state.
- The script then uses process hollowing to inject the decrypted and decompressed Lumma Stealer payload into the explore.exe process.
- In one of our tests, the Lumma Stealer variant delivered an additional "clipper" payload designed to steal cryptocurrency.
- This clipper payload performs clipboard hijacking to redirect cryptocurrency transactions to attacker-controlled wallets.
