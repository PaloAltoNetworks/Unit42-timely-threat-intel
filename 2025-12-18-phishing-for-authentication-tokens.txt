20925-12-18 (THURSDAY): PHISHING TECHNIQUE TO COPY/PASTE AUTHENTICATION TOKENS FROM BROWSER CACHE

NOTES:

- This campaign lures social media content creators by claiming they are eligible for free verified badges.
- The phishing content is hidden behind a human verification page to evade web crawlers
- These pages are designed to steal victims’ authentication tokens in order to bypass MFA.

DETAILS:

- This campaign has been active since at least September 2025.
- The attacks abuse a variety of web hosting platforms.
- Rather than stealing the victim’s username and password, these phishing pages use a different tactic: 
  -- An embedded video instructs users to copy authentication tokens from their browser cookies
  -- Users are instructed to paste the data into a popup form to complete the verification
- The video ends by instructing the user to "not log out for at least 24 hours" in order to keep the authentication tokens valid
