2025-09-17 (WEDNESDAY): MALVERTISING CAMPAIGN USES DANGLING COMMITS IN OFFICIAL GITHUB REPOSITORY

AUTHORS:

- Yoav Zemah, Omer Gil, Asi Greenholts, Gal Bitensky

NOTES:

- Dangling commit is a technique where a commit to a forked repository is presented as if it was part of the original repository.
- For an earlier example of dangling commits, see:
  -- https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/github-actions-supply-chain-attack/#post-138681-_5bj9rp99k4ek

DETAILS:

- Since early August 2025, we've identified at least four different cases where a threat actor leveraged dangling commits.
- This activity is part of a malvertising campaign to push malware disguised as a GitHub desktop client.
- Our telemetry reveals potential victims in the United States, Europe, South America and Asia. 
- Affected industries included communication, tourism, software, public services, e-commerce and retail.
- The overall scheme was as follows:
  -- Create a disposable GitHub user account
  –- Fork the target repository
  –- Create a malicious commit 
  –- Delete the disposable GitHub user account
- This technique abuses the forking functionality and introduces a link for a malicious commit into the legitimate repository
  -- For example: hxxps[:]//www.github[.]com/desktop/desktop/tree/{insert malicious commit hash here}
- The above example might convince victims that it is part of the verified desktop repository, but this link leads to the malicious commit.
- Since GitHub presents a warning at the top of the page, the threat actor used an anchor to link to the middle of the page.
  -- Because of this, potential victims effectively miss the warning.
