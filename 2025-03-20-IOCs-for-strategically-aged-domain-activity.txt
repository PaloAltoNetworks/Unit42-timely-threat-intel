NOTES:

- We've discovered an active campaign that uses strategically aged domains in Traffic Direction System (TDS) activity.
- The final landing pages feature investment scams and part-time job or work-from-home scams.
- Attackers register new domains and delay using them for at least 1 month to evade blocking.
â€” We found over 80k domains that redirect to URLs under linksapp[.]top after the dormant period. 
- This campaign has targeted Japanese and South African users, and it remains active.

ADDITIONAL DETAILS:

- Approximately 58,000 of these 80,000 domains are under the .xyz TLD.
- The domains appear to be automatically generated.
- Most of these domains are a combination of English words and random letters. 
- Some of these domains have registration dates as early as 1997, but:
  -- Their WHOIS records show the initial registration date, likely from a different person or organization.
  -- Nameserver records for these domains have been updated in the past few months.
  -- Since the nameserver updates, these domains started redirecting to links under this campaign. 
  -- For example:
     -- phinzone[.]com was originally registered on 2000-02-12.
     -- WHOIS record updated and nameserver changed on 2024-03-26. 
     -- The domain started redirecting to URLs under linksapp[.]top on 2024-09-20.
- In addition to linksapp[.]top we've also  seen jp.linel[.]top in this campaign.
- This addition indicates the redirection domains may continue to change as the campaign evolves.
- We saw a peak of 15,000 domains registered for this campaign on 2024-08-21.
- On 2024-08-26 we saw 7,987 domains registered.
- We will continue to track and block this campaign, which we internally track as "linksapp_redir"
