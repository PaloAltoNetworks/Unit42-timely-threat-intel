2025-10-07 (FRIDAY): PHISHING EMAILS THAT SPOOF SPAM FILTERS

AUTHOR:

- Reethika Ramesh

NOTES:

- We are currently tracking phishing activity disguised as email security alerts. 
- These messages appear to be sent from the recipient's own email domain.
- The message text falsely claims to have blocked important messages. 
- They instruct recipients to click a button to release these messages.
- The button links to a page impersonating a webmail login site, pre-filled with the recipient's email address.
- The fraudulent webmail page is used to collect and send login credentials to an attacker-controlled host.

DETAILS:

- The phishing emails we found from this activity have several similarities.
- However, the domains for this activity don’t point to a single attacker.
- And we've noted several different types of workflows in the phishing web pages.

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PHISHING EMAILS:

- The email’s sender address is spoofed to fit the recipient's email domain. For example: 
  -- cpanel@[recipient's email domain]
  -- no-reply@[recipient's email domain]
- Citing an "upgraded Secure Message system" which has blocked several seemingly important emails, such as:
  -- Outstanding invoices
  -- Package deliveries
  -- Request for Quotations (RFQs)
- Security notice updates where the subject says "confirm Pending Messages"
  -- The email text states the recipient's "password is set to expire in [insert number here] days"
  -- The text states recipients must take action to avoid account loss
- Request that recipients verify and "whitelist" messages
  -- From a "mailbox quarantine summary from the Anti-Spam System" belonging to the victim’s email domain
  -- Claims quarantined emails with subjects suggesting importance, such as:
     --- Payment advice note
     --- Order inquiries
  -- Messages direct the recipients to click on a phishing link and log in to their email:
  -- Message example: "The quarantine report is generated at 6:00am. To view the most update spam folder or blacklist sender, please login your email."

CHARACTERISTICS OF PAGES THAT IMPERSONATE WEBMAIL LOGIN SITES:

- Attackers abuse shared hosting services to host these phishing sites. Top-level domains (TLDs) include:
  -- surge[.]sh
  -- vercel[.]app
  -- workers[.]dev
- The phishing pages use basic obfuscation techniques to hide the malicious code.
- One landing page used the deprecated 'document.write(escape(...))' function
  -- Replace certain characters with escape sequences, likely done to make the code harder to read
- The phishing pages are designed to trick the user by using trusted logos
- When the user enters their password, it sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a malicious server
  - For example: hxxps[:]//client1.inftrimool[.]xyz/er4.php
- It then shows a fake "The login is invalid" error message for 2 seconds and clears the password field. 
- This is a known tactic to get users to re-enter their password, in case they mistyped it the first time.
- The script sends the login credentials to the attacker again on the second click. 
- After the user has entered their password three times, it redirects the user to a legitimate site:
  -- The user's real domain. [address.tld] for [user-email@address.tld]
  -- Or to the Google search homepage.
- In some cases, we've seen the request blocked due to a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) error. 
  -- For example, if the login credentials are sent to another malicious website,
  -- This likely means the web server hosting the phishing is misconfigured. For example:
     --- The code to generate the HTTP traffic does not contain an ​​Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.

FINAL NOTES:

- Treat all such emails as malicious, and recipients should avoid entering credentials in the linked sites.
- Tactics like using screenshots and logos belonging to the recipient's email domain debuted years ago.
- But we continue seeing:
  -- Renewed efforts with new infrastructure
  -- Improved tactics in email delivery and credential harvesting
