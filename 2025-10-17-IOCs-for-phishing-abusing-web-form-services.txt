NOTES:

- This email-based phishing activity uses HTML attachments that abuse popular web form services.
- These HTML files are phishing pages that impersonate login sites for legitimate online services.
- The HTML files use web form submissions to exfiltrate a victim's login credentials.

DETAILS:

- The associated phishing emails read as business requests to review orders and respond with quotes for pricing.
- The attachments are HTML pages that display logins for legitimate online services like:
  -- Microsoft Excel
  -- Adobe Reader 
  -- Zimbra (an email platform).
- These HTML files are tailored to the individual recipients, using prefilled email addresses.
- If victims submit their login credentials in these pages, the data is sent to the attacker using a legitimate web form service.
- Web form services abused by attackers include:
  -- smartforms[.]dev
  -- submit-form[.]com (formspark[.]io)
- In some cases, these HTML files employ a cloaking technique by redirecting to a legitimate page of the impersonated service provider.
