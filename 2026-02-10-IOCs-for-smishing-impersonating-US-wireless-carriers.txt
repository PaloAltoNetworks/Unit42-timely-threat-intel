2026-02-10 (TUESDAY): SMISHING IMPERSONATING U.S. WIRELESS CARRIERS

AUTHOR:

NOTES:

- We are tracking widespread smishing activity impersonating U.S. wireless carriers.
- This activity represents another evolution in smishing activity we have previously reported. 
- Lures use an "expiring reward points" theme to steal credentials via fraudulent web pages.

DETAILS:

- The smishing campaign is expanding and shifting tactics to impersonate U.S. wireless carriers. 
- We are seeing a surge in "Reward Point" lures targeting Verizon, ATT, and T-Mobile customers.
- We have found over 21,000 hostnames involved in this campaign
  -- An average of 268 new root domains is being registered every day in the week of Jan 12th - 19th.
  -- A peak of 348 root domains registered on 2026/01/12.
- The bait messages claim a large amount of points expiring in the next few days. 
- The links lead to convincing but fake "Member Verification" portals.
- These portals ask for the user's phone number, after which they may send account access requests in an attempt to compromise the user's account.
= The messages originate from a variety of different phone numbers.
- Attackers are sending these smishing texts as group texts to a number of users, but they rename the group message with SMS short codes. 
- The actual message senders have numbers with country codes from:
  -- Democratic Republic of the Congo (+243)
  -- Morocco (+212)
- Som of the SMS messages are sent through email addresses.
- These websites are hosted on popular CDN IP addresses (ASN: AS 16509).
- All three carrier-specific pages include the identical string: 
  "To find out your remaining points and exchange them for prizes, please enter your mobile number."
- This identical string indicates the same threat actor is behind them all.
- This observed smishing campaign has several attributes:
  -- Consistent Infrastructure: The campaign utilizes the same domain registrars, similar hosting infrastructure, and similar landing page cloaking techniques. 
  -- High-Quality Phishing Kits: The phishing kits are of high quality and targeted different US carriers around the same time.
