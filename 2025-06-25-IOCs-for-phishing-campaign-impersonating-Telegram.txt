2025-06-25 (WEDNESDAY): 54K+ DOMAINS USED FOR PHISHING SITES IMPERSONATING TELEGRAM

AUTHORS:

- Reethika Ramesh, Zhanhao Chen

NOTES:

- We recently identified 54,446 domains hosting phishing sites in a campaign impersonating Telegram.
- These pages collect Telegram login credentials submitted and real-time one-time passcodes (OTPs) to hijack user accounts.

DETAILS:

- The phishing sites impersonate the official Telegram login interface to harvest user credentials and OTPs.
- Once the user submits their phone number, the webpage makes a network request to the Telegram API for an OTP.
  -- wss[:]//zws1.web.telegram[.]org/apiws
- If the user enters the OTP, the attacker can use the stolen credentials and OTP to hijack the user's session on Telegram web.
- We tested one of the phishing sites by submitting a phone number and typing the wrong OTP code multiple times
  -- This prevented a web login through the phishing site, citing "Too many attempts. Try again in 24 hours." 
  -- Following this, we tried logging in to the same Telegram account via the legitimate Telegram web login.
  -- Through the legitimate Telegram site, the phone number was still flagged for too many login attempts.
  -- This shows the phishing page submits the victimâ€™s phone number to the Telegram login API via WebSocket. 
- Some domains for this campaign host Android application (.apk) files that impersonate the Telegram app.
  -- Example: SHA256 hash: 141b2f58d730a6875b9214bfd152283282ca0e0ad88d5bfc6843bd7fb5beda3b
- The number of domains registered for this campaign peaked in March 2025, with 16.1k domains registered in that month alone.
- We have seen approximately 17.3K domains registered since then.
- In the last month, we saw an average of almost 200 domains registered every day.
- Domain registrars include:
  -- 48.6% of the domains were registered through Dynadot LLC 
  -- 32.6% of the domains were registered through Chengdu West Dimension Digital Technology Co., Ltd.
- 94.4% of these domains use nameservers from the same provider.
- Chinese language in a JavaScript file from one of the phishing sites indicates that the attacker may be a Chinese-speaking threat actor.
- We track this campaign as "telegram_acc_hijack"
