NOTES:

- We've noted an SMS phishing (smishing) campaign impersonating the California Franchise Tax Board.
- Domain names for the associated websites use combinations of "FTB," "CA" and "gov" to trick users. 
- These sites claim to offer tax refunds, but they only collect sensitive information from victims.
- Collected data includes SSN, address and payment information.
- This campaign is expanding to target tax departments in other U.S. states such as North Dakota and Ohio.

DETAILS:

- These text messages are the latest wave of smishing targeting services and government organizations in the US and worldwide.
- Over 400 domains were registered in the past week alone for this campaign.
- URLs from these texts lead to phishing pages that masquerade as Californiaâ€™s Franchise Tax Board government website.
- Phishing pages ask users to submit their SSN, address and other information such as debit card numbers.
- Smishing messages are now more frequently sent from US phone numbers.
- This is a shift from previous instances where the text messages were sent from foreign numbers or even email addresses.
- Most of the phishing domains resolve to two IP addresses: 43.153.19[.]10 and 170.106.140[.]181.
- Over 56% of the domains were registered through Dominet (HK) Limited, and 33% were registered through Namesilo.
- This follows the domain registration trend observed in the prior campaigns impersonating toll services we track: com_smishing and gov_smishing.
- We track indicators for this activity under the gov_smishing campaign.
