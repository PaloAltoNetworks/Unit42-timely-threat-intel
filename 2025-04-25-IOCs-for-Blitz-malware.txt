2025-04-25 (FRIDAY): WINDOWS BOT MALWARE "BLITZ" ABUSES HUGGING FACE SERVICES

AUTHOR:

- Dominik Reichel

NOTES:

- Since last year, we've been tracking a Windows bot malware named "Blitz."
- The infection chain consists of different stages with an initial dropper, a downloader and main botnet component
- We believe the initial infection vector is either a backdoored game cheat for recent samples or an installer for older samples.
- The backdoored game cheats are advertised on the malware operator's Telegram channel.
- This threat actor abuses Hugging Face's AI app directory named "Spaces" to host the bot malware and perform command and control C2 functions.
- The ultimate goal seems to be dropping a cryptocurrency miner on victims' machines.

DETAILS

- Since tracking this malware last year, we discovered a new version that consists of several stages:
  -- The initial file is either a custom installer or a backdoored game cheat that retrieves the first-stage downloader.
  -- The first stage downloader retrieves the main "Blitz" bot component from a Hugging Face Space.
  -- The main bot file communicates with the malware C2 hosted on the same Hugging Face Space to send victim information and download commands or payloads.
  -- The ultimate goal seems to be downloading an XMRig cryptocurrency miner on the victim's system
- The initial backdoored game cheats were for the Android game Standoff 2.
  -- The malware operator maintains a Telegram channel with posts of backdoored game cheats that are available to download.
  -- The (working) cheats used for the backdoor are obtained from other Telegram channels.
  -- The backdoored cheats are supposed to run from the Windows Android emulator BluestStacks.
- The malware C2 is a REST API hosted on a Hugging Face Space.
  -- The malware REST API is developed with the FastAPI framework.
  -- To run the FastAPI app, the built-in Docker SDK of a Hugging Face Space is used.
