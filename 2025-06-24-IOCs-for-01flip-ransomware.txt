NOTES:

- We've observed a new ransomware nicknamed "01flip" because of the .01flip file extension for its encrypted files. 
- The sample of 01flip ransomware we've seen is fully written in Rust.
- Using less-common programming languages in malware development like Rust is a possible strategy to evade detection.
- So far, 01flip ransomware appears to have been deployed to a very limited set of targets.
- This limited distribution indicates 01flip ransomware is not a part of the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) ecosystem.
- 01flip ransomware does not have the capability to exfiltrate files. 
- We confirmed that the threat actor behind this ransomware contacted a victim through a private chat to pay 1 BTC for decryption.

OPERATIONS:

- Once 01flip ransomware is executed, it enumerates files across specific drives.
- If the files have targeted extensions in their file names, 01flip ransomware encrypts them.
- The ransomware also creates ransom notes, RECOVER-YOUR-FILE.TXT, in the targeted folders.
- Encrypted file names use the following format: 

  <ORIGINAL_FILENAME>.<UNIQUE_ID>.<COUNT>.01flip

- After completing encryption, 01flip ransomware erases itself from the disk using the following command:

  ping 127.0.0.7 -n 5 > Nul & fsutil file setZeroData offset=0 length=4194303 [MALWARE_FILEPATH] > Nul & Del /f /q [MALWARE_FILEPATH]

01FLIP RANSOMWARE NOTE:

== IMPORTANT ==
Your files have been encrypted. Do not attempt to recover them yourself, as this may cause irreversible damage.
Once we receive payment, we will immediately provide the decryption key to restore your data. 
Every hour of delay increases the risk of permanent data loss.
