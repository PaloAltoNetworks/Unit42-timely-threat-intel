2025-04-10 (THURSDAY): PHISHING PAGES IMPERSONATING NINTENDO 

AUTHORS:

- Reethika Ramesh, Shu Wang

NOTES:

- We've seen several recently-registered domains using the string "nintendo" in their names.
- These domains appeared shortly after Nintendo announced its Switch 2 gaming console.
- We found phishing sites and monetized parking pages associated with these domains.
- The phishing pages use copies of Nintendo's logos and character images to trick users.

DETAILS:

- The phishing domains use the same template and present a customer service chatbot.
- These phishing domain chatbots ask for a viewer's name and email address.
- The domains for monetized parked pages present links to related content under the same domain.
  -- Example: hxxps[:]//ww16.nintendothailand[.]com/?sub1=20250410-0702-18b4-876d-4d080b7aafe0
- Registration peaked on 2025-04-03 with 15 newly registered domains, compared to a daily average of 3.

RELATED ACTIVITY:

- Other Nintendo-themed domains have been registered in the past year, before the Switch 2 announcements.
- Some of these Nintendo-themed domains host sites that generate Traffic Direction System (TDS) traffic.
- Two examples are classicnintendo[.]com and nintendobro[.]com.
- The final pages from the TDS traffic often contain unwanted content like scareware and suspicious antivirus sites.
