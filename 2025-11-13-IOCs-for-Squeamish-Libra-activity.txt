NOTES:

- Unit 42 recently identified several suspicious files while investigating a report on an SSH-based backdoor linked to the cybercrime group FIN7, which we track as Squeamish Libra.
- The malware has likely been used in the wild since at least 2022 and is seemingly downloaded from a remote server hosting a ZIP file containing a script labeled "install.bat."
- Based on open source reporting, the malware enables its operators to establish a persistent mechanism, create reverse SSH tunnels for command-and-control (C2) communications and exfiltrate data via SFTP.
- We continue to hunt for additional samples and other indicators associated with this ongoing threat activity.

BACKGROUND:

- FIN7 has likely been active since at least 2013 and previously targeted a number of different sectors including retail, hospitality, and financial services.
- The group has evolved its monetization tactics over the years from using point-of-sale (POS) malware to big game hunting (BGH) ransomware.
- The malware has previously been analyzed by a number of reputable sources and there have seemingly been few changes to its code base from inception to now.
