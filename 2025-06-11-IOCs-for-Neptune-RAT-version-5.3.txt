2025-06-11 (WEDNESDAY): NEPTUNE RAT (MASON RAT) VERSION 5.3 SPREAD THROUGH JS FILES

AUTHOR:

- Vishwa Tothathri

NOTES:

- We've discovered a new version of Neptune RAT, at version 5.3 seen in the wild as early as 2025-05-27.
- The Mason Team created this RAT, and configuration data from our analysis of this sample indicates it is named "Mason RAT."
- The initial lure for this infection is a JavaScript (.js) file that is run by wscript.exe when double-clicked.
- The .js file drops a .bat file to disk, and subsequent files are not saved to disk, but run from system memory.
- The infection is kept persistent by copying the .bat file to C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\

DETAILS:

- The .js and .bat files contain: 
  -- Base64-encoded text for a PowerShell script that performs the following functions:
  	 --- Patch AMSI.dll to disable Microsoft's Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI)
  	 --- Patch/disable Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)
  -- Base64-encoded text for two encoded/encrypted binaries that represent two .NET executable files
  -- An obfuscated decoder/decryptor to create the .NET executable files from the above two binaries

- This latest version of Neptune RAT can receive a variety of commands from its C2 server: 
  -- system data exfiltration
  -- crypto clipper
  -- screenshot
  -- mouse movement
  -- keyboard activity logger
  -- download additional .dll files for additional plugin functionality
