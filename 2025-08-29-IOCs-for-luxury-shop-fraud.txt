2025-08-29 (FRIDAY): LUXURY SHOP FRAUD CAMPAIGN

AUTHORS:

- Reethika Ramesh, Zhanhao Chen, Daiping Liu

NOTES:

- We discovered a phishing campaign that uses email to distribute links to fraudulent shopping sites claiming to sell luxury goods.
- The websites use similar phishing page templates and direct payments through PayPal using different company names on the invoices.

DETAILS:

- Example Email subjects:
  -- 0MEGA & R0LEX from $250 - Timeless Elegance
  -- Discover Luxury Watches at Unbeatable Prices!
  -- Exclusive Luxury Bags at Only $200!
- The sender’s email addresses belong to domains that are either NXDOMAINs now or resolve to malicious IP addresses.
  -- The following Autonomous Systems (AS) for these IP addresses are in Vietnam (AS 149137, AS 149123, AS 149125). 
- Most of the initial entry websites are under the .ru and .рф TLDs. 
- These initial websites redirect users to the main phishing website hosting the fake shopping pages.
- The initial entry domains and the phishing sites resolve to IP addresses in popular cloud providers in the US. 
- These pages show luxury products such as watches and handbags with large discounts. 
- These shopping pages do not use any input validation on the user information and shipping address entered for an order.
- Upon advancing to the "confirm order" page, the site redirects users to PayPal to pay the invoice.
- The fake luxury product  pages are registered through “CNOBIN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY LIMITED". 
- Over 40% of domains registered with this registrar are malicious, which gives this registrar a high malicious reputation.
- This campaign has been active over the past three months.
- Passive DNS traffic shows that traffic towards these domains peaked around July 17, 2025.
- We track this campaign as luxury_shop_fraud.
