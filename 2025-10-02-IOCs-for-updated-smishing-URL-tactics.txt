2025-10-02 (THURSDAY): UPDATED SMISHING URL TACTICS

AUTHORS:

- Reethika Ramesh, Zhanhao Chen, Daiping Liu, Keerthiraj Nagaraj, Anton Ohorodnyk,  Fan Fei

NOTES:

- We've seen an increase in smishing URLs with the name of a trusted entity before an "@" symbol followed by the true domain.
- This wave of attacks also involves cloaking, deceptively named group texts and strategically aged hostnames.

DETAILS:

- Use of "@" symbol:

  -- We've seen at least 2170 URLs using "@" symbol before the domain in these smishing texts.
  -- For example, www.fedex[.]com@servicece[.]co contains www.fedex[.]com before the malicious domain servicece[.]co.
  -- Browsers will navigate to the real domain in the URL, the part after the “@” symbol.
  -- In this case, the browser directly makes a connection to the domain servicece[.]co.
  -- This pattern was initially designed for HTTP Basic Authentication, and these are valid URLs based on RFC-1738. 
     --- However, this pattern was abandoned due to the security implications of exposing usernames and/or passwords.
     --- It could lead to account compromises due to logging in browser history, or through network sniffing.
     --- As a result, this syntax no longer works as originally intended on modern browsers. 
     --- Browsers strip the username and password from the URL before generating the web traffic.
  -- Of note: Over 30% of the domain names from this campaign have high lexical similarity.
     --- They start with "serve", "service", "serving" or "serv". 

- Cloaking:

  -- The final landing pages employ cloaking. 
  -- Crawling these landing pages only reveals error messages, or they redirect to popular pages. 
  -- Navigating to the URL on a mobile phone renders the actual phishing page.


- Deceptively named group texts: 

  -- Attackers send these smishing messages as group texts to multiple recipients,
  -- But attackers rename the group message with a 6-digit number to resemble SMS short codes. 
     --- These SMS short codes are typically used by businesses and others organizations.
     --- They are used to send one-time passwords (OTPs), marketing texts, and confirmation messages. 
  -- If recipients only notice the 6-digit group name, they might believe it comes from trusted source.

- Strategically Aged Hostnames: 

  -- Many of the domains observed in this campaign are strategically aged. 
  -- Domains in this campaign have been registered as early as one year before their use in this campaign. 
  -- A majority of these domains were aged between 3 and 12 months, with a peak amount of registration in June 2025.
  -- Although most were strategically aged, at least 302 domains in this campaign were registered and used in September 2025.
