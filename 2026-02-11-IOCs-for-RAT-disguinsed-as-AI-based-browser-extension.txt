2026-02-11 (WEDNESDAY): REMOTE ACCESS TROJAN (RAT) DISGUISED AS AI-BASED BROWSER CONTROL EXTENSION

AUTHORS:

NOTES:

- A browser extension called "Chrome MCP Server - AI Browser Control" is a fully functional browser-based Remote Access Trojan (RAT).
  -- It's disguised as an AI automation tool using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
  -- Extension ID: fpeabamapgecnidibdmjoepaiehokgda
- The listing for this extension falsely claims "100% local processing - your data never leaves your browser."
- When enabled, the extension establishes a WebSocket connection to a remote C2 server at wss[:]//mcp-browser.qubecare[.]ai/chrome.
  -- The C2 server is currently live and operational.
  -- The server is set up to receive information from a host with this browser extension.
- When connected from a sandbox, the C2 server assigned a unique sessionId and connectionId with no authentication required
  -- This confirms a purpose-built session management infrastructure for controlling victim browsers.
- The extension accepts 30+ remote commands, including:
  -- arbitrary JavaScript execution via new Function()
  -- Chrome Debugger Protocol attachment for HTTPS traffic interception
  -- form filling
  -- screenshot capture
  -- browsing history access
  -- authenticated request replay with the browser cookies
- The remote code execution vector at background.js uses: new Function("return " + data.params.script)()
  -- This string from the remote server is executed as JavaScript in the context of the victim's active tab. 

DETAILS:

- The extension requests an aggressive permission set, such as:
  -- debugger
  -- webRequest
  -- scripting
  -- tabs
  -- history
  -- bookmarks
  -- host_permissions on <all_urls>
- In addition to the aggressive permission set, this extension results in a content script injected into every page.
- The chrome.debugger API is used to attach the Chrome DevTools Protocol to any tab.
  -- This enables Network.enable and Network.getResponseBody to read decrypted HTTPS response bodies 
  -- This results in bypassing all transport security.
- Network surveillance is implemented via chrome.webRequest listeners on <all_urls>.
  -- It captures request bodies, request headers (including cookies and auth tokens), and response headers from every tab.
- An inject script (network-helper.js) uses fetch with credentials: 'include' to replay network requests with the victim's cookies.
  -- This allows remote operators to make authenticated API calls as the user to any service they are logged into.
- A persistent user ID is generated, stored in chrome.storage.local, and injected into every webpage.
  -- This is accomplished via window.chromeExtensionUserId and sessionStorage
  -- This enables cross-site tracking of victims.
- The root C2 domain qubecare[.]ai was registered 2025-03-24 and appears to host a legitimate websites.
- The C2 server at mcp-browser.qubecare[.]ai is hosted on 162.245.187[.]98.
- The C2 server uses a Let's Encrypt TLS certificate for its HTTPS traffic.
- No public source code repository exists for this extension despite its open source claim on the web store page.

LIVE SANDBOX VERIFICATION:

- WebSocket connection to wss[:]//mcp-browser.qubecare[.]ai/chrome returned readyState 1 (OPEN).
- The extension's connection_info handshake produced a server response: 

  {"type":"session_info","sessionInfo":{"userId":"user_1707700000000_sandbox",
  "sessionId":"session_user_1707700000000_sandbox",
  "connectionId":"conn_cdcd5f47-1afc-4b77-8068-00adb0f29c17"},"timestamp":1770832821745}. 

- The server accepts any WebSocket client and assigns sessions without authentication.
- The HTTP endpoint returns OpenResty server headers with access-control-allow-credentials: true
  -- This is consistent with the extension's cross-origin authenticated request patterns.
