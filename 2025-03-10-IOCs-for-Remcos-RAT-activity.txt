NOTES:

- Email remains a consistent vector for malware distribution.
- Most of these emails are caught by spam traps and other security filters.
- Criminals continue trying different methods to sneak malware past this filtering.
- One such method is using a different file extension for an attached zip archive.
- In this example, the email attachment is a zip archive that uses a file extension for a 7-Zip archive.
- On a Windows 11 host, File Manager extracted the malware from the zip archive, 
  even though the file archive used a .7z file extension, and 7-Zip was not installed on the system.

INFECTION CHAIN:

- email --> attached archive --> extracted script file with .bat extension
