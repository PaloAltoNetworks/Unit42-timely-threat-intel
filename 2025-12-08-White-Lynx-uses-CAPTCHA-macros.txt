NOTES:

- We discovered a new social engineering technique used by the Belarus-based threat actor White Lynx (Ghostwriter, Storm-0257, UNC1151).
- This technique uses a malicious macro in a Word document to evade detection and analysis.
- Enabling macros will display a fake CAPTCHA window requesting users to validate a 6-character string.
- This verification process adds a layer of human interaction required before the macro will proceed.
- After the CAPTCHA has been verified, the document displays decoy content while performing malicious actions in the background.

DETAILS ON THE MALWARE:

- If macros are not enabled, the malicious Word document first shows text in both English and Ukrainian stating:

  To view the document, you need to confirm that you are not a robot. To do this, enable macros and complete the verification process.
  
- Enabling macros reveals the decoy content, which impersonates a memorandum from a Ukrainian official.
- A Google translation of the text to English follows:

-----
UKRAINE

OLIIVSKA VILLAGE COUNCIL
ZHYTOMYR DISTRICT, ZHYTOMYR REGION
12402 village of Oliivka, Leonid Stupnytskyi st., 68, lobkoleg@ukr.net (067)164 77 37

Dated 04.10.2025

In connection with the military invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine, the complication of the operational situation in the region, the Oliivska Village Council offers to provide you with material assistance in the amount of 50,000.00 (fifty thousand UAH. 00 kopecks) to meet the priority needs associated with defense and repelling the aggressor.
Please provide a response on the results of considering the letter.

- The macro code also drops a 95,744-byte DLL file at C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\EReciver\EdgeService.dll and runs it.
- The DLL generates HTTP POST requests to the C2 server at agelessinvesting[.]xyz approximately once every minute.
- The HTTP POST request contains a cookie with data about the infected Windows host encoded as a Base64 string.
- The DLL is similar to those used in previously documented attacks by this group, such as:
  -- https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/ghostwriter-new-campaign-targets-ukrainian-government-and-belarusian-opposition/

- Since the memorandum is impersonating a mayor in the Zhytomyr region of Ukraine, this area is the likely target of the malware.
