NOTES:

- ClickFix-based campaigns have rotated through different types of commands for clipboard-injected text.
- In late December 2025, we saw the KongTuke campaign use DNS TXT records in its ClickFix text.
- These campaigns cycle through various ClickFix techniques, like using the finger protocol or mshta.
- We will continue to monitor ClickFix campaigns for any further use of DNS TXT records.
