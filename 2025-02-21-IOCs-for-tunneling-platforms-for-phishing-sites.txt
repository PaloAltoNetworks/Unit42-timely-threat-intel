AUTHORS:

- Howard Tong, Shehroze Farooqi, Alex Starov

DETAILS:

- Tunnel services often include a free tier that criminals often abuse to host phishing pages.
- These tunnels share internal resources without having to host the data on a public server.
- Open-source phishing kits include features to use some of these popular tunneling platforms.
- This simplifies the process for attackers to exploit these popular services. 
- We continue finding examples of phishing sites abusing tunneling services before they are publicly reported.
