2026-01-30 (FRIDAY): "TRAFFIC TICKET SEARCH PORTAL" PHISHING CAMPAIGN

AUTHORS:

- Keerthiraj Nagaraj, Shehroze Farooqi

NOTES: 

We identified a sophisticated phishing campaign impersonating the Government of Canada and specific provincial agencies (Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan). 

The campaign lures victims to a fake "Traffic Ticket Search Portal" under the pretense of paying outstanding traffic violations.

DETAILS:

Impersonation Targets: 

The campaign features a central landing page that redirects users to province-specific sub-pages (e.g., /on/ for Ontario, /ab/ for Alberta) mimicking the branding of local provincial governments.

SEO Poisoning & Search Indexing: 

The attackers have successfully indexed their malicious domains on major search engines. Evidence shows the phishing domain my-traffic-ticket-portal[.]com appearing as a top search result (2nd ranking) for queries such as "traffic ticket search portal government of Canada," significantly increasing the campaign's reach and credibility.

Infrastructure & Patterns:

All identified domains contain ‘ticket’ substring in it and are hosted on a single IP address: 198.23.156.130.

WHOIS Registration: 

WHOIS data reveals a cluster of registrations occurring on November 29 2025. The primary registrar used is MAT BAO CORPORATION (Registrant Country: Malaysia). 

Older domains in this campaign used "Global Domain Group LLC" for registration and were registered in September-October (likely for early testing before before 10 more domains were registered in November 2025)

Data Exfiltration: 

Victim data (license plates, address, date of birth, phone/email, credit card numbers) is intercepted via JavaScript and asynchronously POSTed to a backend controller located at ../ipanel/inc/action.php rather than legitimate government servers.

Real-Time Control ("Waiting Room"):

The kit utilizes a "waiting room" tactic where the victim's browser polls the server (status.php?type=getstatus) every 2 seconds.

This allows the attacker to hold the victim on a loading screen and manually trigger redirects based on specific status codes (e.g., status '9' redirects to sms.php for OTP interception, status '81' redirects to mfa.php).

Liveness Checks ("Heartbeat"): 

The pages include a "heartbeat" function (pinger) that sends a request to action.php?type=ping every second. This provides the attacker with live feedback that a victim is currently active and ready to be manipulated.

Data Theft Flow: 

The attack follows a multi-stage theft process:

1) License Plate Harvest: User enters a license plate number.
2) PII: Collects name, address, email, phone number, birthdate 
3) Fake Debt Display: The site displays a fabricated "ticket amount" (e.g., $55.00).
4) Financial Theft: User is directed to a payment page to enter Credit Card Number, Expiry, and CVV.
