NOTES: 

- We identified a phishing campaign that utilizes SEO poisoning to direct search engine results to fake traffic ticket portals.
- These portals impersonate the Government of Canada and specific provincial agencies.
  -- Provincial agencies: Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan. 
- The campaign lures victims to a fake "Traffic Ticket Search Portal" under the pretense of paying outstanding traffic violations.

DETAILS:

Impersonation Targets: 

- The campaign features a central landing page that redirects users to province-specific sub-pages
- Sub-pages mimic the branding of local provincial governments.
- URLs contain the two-letter code for each province. For example:
  -- URLs for an Ontario page contain: /on/
  -- URLs for an Alberta page contain: /ab/

SEO Poisoning & Search Indexing: 

- The attackers successfully indexed their malicious domains on major search engines. 
- Queries such as "traffic ticket search portal government of Canada" significantly increased this campaign's reach and credibility.
- For example, the domain my-traffic-ticket-portal[.]com appeared as a top search result (2nd ranking) in November 2025.

Infrastructure & Patterns:

- All identified domains contain a substring of the term ‘ticket’ and were hosted on a single IP address: 198.23.156[.]130.

WHOIS Registration: 

- WHOIS data reveals a cluster of registrations occurred on 2025-11-29. 
- The primary registrar used is MAT BAO CORPORATION (Registrant Country: Malaysia). 
- Older domains in this campaign used "Global Domain Group LLC" for registration and were registered in September-October 2025.
  -- These were likely for early testing before 10 more domains were registered in November 2025.

Data Exfiltration: 

- Submitted data includes license plates, address, date of birth, phone/email and credit card numbers
- This data is intercepted via JavaScript and asynchronously POSTed to a backend controller rather than legitimate government servers.
- The URL for the backend controller is located at ../ipanel/inc/action.php

Real-Time Control ("Waiting Room"):

- The kit for these phishing pages utilizes a "waiting room" tactic
- In this tactic, the viewer's browser polls the server (status.php?type=getstatus) every 2 seconds.
- This allows the attacker to hold viewers on a loading screen and manually trigger redirects based on specific status codes.
  -- For example
     --- Status code '9' redirects to a URL ending in sms.php for OTP interception
     --- Status '81' redirects to a URL ending in mfa.php.

Liveness Checks ("Heartbeat"): 

- These phishing pages include a "heartbeat" function that acts as a pinger
- This pinger sends a request to action.php?type=ping every second. 
- The pinger provides the attacker with live feedback that a viewer is currently active and ready to be manipulated.

Data Theft Flow: 

- The attack follows a multi-stage theft process:

  1) License Plate Harvest: User enters a license plate number.
  2) PII: Collects name, address, email, phone number, birthdate 
  3) Fake Debt Display: The site displays a fabricated "ticket amount" (e.g., $55.00).
  4) Financial Theft: User is directed to a payment page to enter Credit Card Number, Expiry, and CVV.
