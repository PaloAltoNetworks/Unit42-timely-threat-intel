2026-02-20 (FRIDAY): TECH SUPPORT SCAM ACTIVITY

AUTHORS:

- Shawn Shuang, Shehroze Farooqi, Keerthiraj Nagaraj, Alex Starov

NOTES:

- A tech support scam campaign displays web pages targeting Japanese speakers.
- These web pages leverage multiple browser APIs for victim containment, including:
  -- full-screen API lock
  -- keyboard API hijacking
  -- Web Worker (JavaScript API) resource exhaustion
  -- Browser window re-spawning on close attempts
- These tech support scam web pages use encrypted JavaScript to evade detection.

DETAILS:

- Infrastructure Mimicry: Leverages SaaS hosting on web.core.windows[.]net 
  -- Spoofs official Windows domains, lending a false sense of legitimacy to the URL.
- Resource Exhaustion: Spawns a significant number of Web Workers containing infinite loops.
  -- Effectively freezes the browser, preventing users from closing the tab or navigating away.
- Fragment-Based Encryption: The malicious payload remains encrypted until a specific URL fragment key is provided. 
  -- This tactic bypasses static detection tools and complicates manual sandbox analysis.
- Interface Hijacking: Employs click hijacking to force the browser into full-screen mode and trigger keyboard lock APIs.
  -- This strips the user of control over their own hardware.
- Heuristic Evasion: Embeds "noise" content into the HTML code of the page.
  -- The noise content concerns benign topics like cooking, gardening, and music theory. 
  -- This hidden text is designed to trick content-based security filters into classifying the page as harmless.
- Scale: We have observed 2,366 hits of URLs for this activity.
  -- Timeframe: From 2026-01-13 to 2026-02-09.
  -- Scope: From 285 unique IP addresses.
